<title>The Semi-empicical Mass Formula</title>

<h1>What is the semi-empicial mass formula?</h1>

The structure of nuclei is dependant on several physical phenomena for which a comprehensive physical model is difficult to produce. However, we can employ semi-empirical arguments to gain understanding of nuclear structure.
For example, it would be reasonable to assume that the binding energy of a nucleus is proportional to the volume ( or equivelently the number of nucleons, A). 
<br><br>
Thus as a first step in formulating in our semi-empirical model we can write the binding energy <math> E<sub>b</sub></math> as
<br>
<math> E<sub>b</sub> = a<sub>v</sub> A</math>
<br>
where <math> a<sub>v</sub></math> is a constant of proportionality. 

We do not know what this constant of proportionality is, and must rely on experiments to determine it - this is why the model is semi-empirical.

<br><br>
Similarly we can propose that the total binding energy is composed of more terms resulting from the nucleus' surface, Coulomb interaction, asymmetry energy (from Pauli exclusion principle) and pairing energy (due to spin coupling).
This results in the semi-empirical mass formula which predicts the binding energy of a nucleus as a function of its nucleon number, <math>A</math> and proton number <math>Z</math>

Each term begins with a constant of proportionality that regulates the strength of each of the physical phenomena.

To me this equation is nice, but it is a little dry. 
<br><br>
To get a better understanding of how the binding energy is affected by each phenomenon, I would like to see what happens if I vary the constants of proportionality - how would nuclei be if Coulomb interaction was three times as strong, or if the Pauli exclusion principle didn't exist? 
<br><br>
This can be done with my <a href="./SEMF.html" style="color:#FF0000;">interactive plot</a>, which shows you the binding energy per nucleon as a function of neutron and proton numbers. You can play God by varying each constant and see the resulting stabilities of nuclei (remember that stable nuclei have a large binding energy per nucleon). 
<br><br>
Have fun!
